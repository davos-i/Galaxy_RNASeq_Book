It is broken into 2 workflows. A workflow is a set of tools on galaxy organised together to do certain tasks. These workflows are shareable and are included here. Workflow Step 1 The first workflow is designed to rename files, run quality check for each file and join any files together that are from the same sample (see 5). It also calculates some other values required for Step 2, such as the length of bp of the transcripts. Once the output is checked (FastQC via a MultiQC report), the concatenated files can be used as input to Step 2. Workflow Step 2 Step 2 User profile You will need to be signed in to complete this analysis. Make sure you use university email address when setting up profile. Registered users with an Australian research institute are allocated 600GB, otherwise only 100GB is allocated.

Follow figures below. Figure 2.1: Click Upload Data button Figure 2.2: Select Collection from the top ribbon and click Choose local files button Figure 2.3: Navigate to the files to upload and highlight them all using Shift or Ctrl keys to help, then click Open Figure 2.4: Click Start button to begin uploading files. Keep this website open until it is finished. 2.1.2 Add files to a collection Once the files have uploaded they will appear in the History pane. Next, we add them to a collection, which is basically just a list of files. It allows all files to be parsed through a workflow one by one. For example, if a tool was used on a collection, then each item in the list/collection would invoke its own job while all output is kept within a collection in the history. Figure 2.5: Select Operations on multiple datasets then select all items to add to collection Figure 2.6: Click For all selected then Build dataset list Figure 2.7: Type a name for the list and click Create collection button Figure 2.8: All files should now be in a collection in the History pane. 2.2 Rename Files This step renames the files to more meaningful and user friendly names. To do this, a new file is imported with the old names and the new names. This should be a tab delimited .txt file with 2 columns of data. The 1st column has original name (which is likely to be filename) and the 2nd column has new names. E.g. original filename might be SQ_049_HMJ7NDRXY_TATGATGGCC-TATGACAATC_L001_R1.fastq.gz whereas new name could be changed to include treatment information such as ST_811_P5_L001. It is important that the \"_L\" number is included at the end, even if there is not multiple lanes per sample. This will be dealt with by the Step 1 workflow. See section 2.2.1. Use the upload data feature of galaxy to import the .txt file to to the History. It should look something like 2.9. Figure 2.9: Example of text file imported to History with original and new filenames This .txt file can be made in Excel, or it can be done much quicker using a simple R script. The following is an example script: # list file names and create table with new file names for use in galaxy&#39;s &quot;Relabel list identifiers&quot; tool library(tidyverse) library(data.table) #list the names of the fastq files in the working directory file_list &lt;- list.files(path = &quot;E:/RNAseq - P steers ST 20211212/&quot;, pattern = &quot;.fastq&quot;) #list .csv files to select the .csv file that contains sample information files_csv &lt;- list.files(path = &quot;E:/RNAseq - P steers ST 20211212/&quot;, pattern = &quot;.csv&quot;) #selects the correct .csv file, in this case there is only 1 file anyway, but the correct file can be selected by entering it&#39;s number in the list in the [] selected_file &lt;- files_csv[1] message(paste(&quot;Selected file -&quot;, selected_file)) #import the selected file, making sure no columns have the same name sample_IDs &lt;- fread(file = paste0(&quot;E:/RNAseq - P steers ST 20211212/&quot;,selected_file)) %&gt;% as_tibble(.name_repair = &quot;unique&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(`Steer ID` = as.character(`Steer ID`)) #As the file names have a set structure, it can be split by the _ character df_file_names_split &lt;- str_split(file_list, pattern = &quot;_&quot;, simplify = TRUE) %&gt;% as.data.frame() #In this example, the &#39;key&#39; column is the RNAseq_ID column.

It would be easier to ask the lab to provide the output as a single file, which can be computed using the --no-lane-splitting option from Illuminas bcl2fastq program. However, it can also be handled in Galaxy. If there are multiple files, it is best practice to run FastQC on each individual file, as there is a chance that one file could be corrupt or you may identify a bias for one particular Lane. If they are ok, then these files can be concatenated together before proceeding with all further steps. This is described further in 5. Make sure the new names generated in 2.2 have a format that includes \"_L\". The protocol relies on there being a _L in the name for it to find the lane number. The rest of the name before the _L should be the same. E.g. the following three files would be concatenated together by the Step 1 workflow: 2139_Stage 2_Fast_L008 2139_Stage 2_Fast_L007 2139_Stage 2_Fast_L006 2.3 Import ENSEMBL files In this step we need to import the required fastq file for sequence alignment and a gtf file for gene annotation. These can be uploaded directly to Galaxy via a URL. To find the required files, navigate to http://ftp.ensembl.org in a browser. For sheep (ovis_aries) these might be: http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-100/fasta/ovis_aries/dna/Ovis_aries.Oar_v3.1.dna.toplevel.fa.gz http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-100/gtf/ovis_aries/Ovis_aries.Oar_v3.1.100.gtf.gz For cattle (bos_taurus) these might be: http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-100/fasta/bos_taurus/dna/Bos_taurus.ARS-UCD1.2.dna.toplevel.fa.gz http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-100/gtf/bos_taurus/Bos_taurus.ARS-UCD1.2.100.gtf.gz Note that unmasked files are used here (i.e. use files without _rm or _sm). To upload these to Galaxy, use the Paste/Fetch data button in the Upload data dialogue box on Galaxy. Figure 2.10: Paste each URL on a new line to upload directly from ENSEMBL to Galaxy. Once executed, 2 new files will appear in the History, each named as the URL entered. This can take some time to finish as they are large files. 2.3.1 Uncompress .gtf file These files are actually .gz files, which means they are compressed. Normally, this is automatically handled by Galaxy but does not currently work for the .gtf file when using it with the STAR Aligner in this workflow. Therefore, use the tool https://usegalaxy.org.au/root?tool_id=CONVERTER_gz_to_uncompressed to uncompress the .gtf file before proceeding. Once it is uncompressed it may not have the correct file format attributed to it in Galaxy. Fix this by using the auto-detect feature within the Datatypes ribbon of the Edit Attributes section. Figure 2.11: Click edit attributes then navigate to Datatypes to use the Auto-Detect. Otherwise manually set it to .gtf "],["step1.html", "Chapter 3 Workflow - Step 1 3.1 Find workflow 3.2 Run workflow 3.3 View results", " Chapter 3 Workflow - Step 1 Once all of the data is uploaded to Galaxy it is time to run/invoke the workflows. The first workflow is relatively fast compared to Step 2, but is important for QC and to prepare data. 3.1 Find workflow The workflow used here is published at: https://usegalaxy.org.au/u/dave-innes/w/rna-seq-step-1 This workflow will need to be imported into your personal galaxy profile. Navigate to: https://usegalaxy.org.au/workflows/import On this page you will be able to enter the workflow URL above. This will also be required for Step 2. You can also navigate directly the workflows URL and import it from there. 3.2 Run workflow To view your workflows, click on the Workflow link at the top of the page. Figure 3.1: Click the Run Workflow button Once youve clicked Run Workflow it will let you select the files it should use and show all of the steps it will complete. Select the appropriate files for 1 and 2. All other steps will not require user input. Figure 3.2: Select list of fastq files for number 1 and select the table of new names for number 2, then click Run Workflow This will invoke all steps and you will see them in the History. 3.3 View results Once all steps are completed you will see the each part of the History has turned green. Figure 3.3: Example output in history after running first workflow The most interesting data will be found in the MultiQC webpage. It can be Viewed within galaxy but it may view better if downloaded and opened up in web browser. Figure 3.4: View the MultiQC webpage report There is plenty of help included in the report and it is worth noting that some sections will normally fail for RNAseq data. Although unlikely, it is also important to check if there are any major quality differences between lanes before proceeding (if multiple lanes exist).

It would be easier to ask the lab to provide the output as a single file, which can be computed using the --no-lane-splitting option from Illuminas bcl2fastq program.

If there are multiple files, it is best practice to run FastQC on each individual file, as there is a chance that one file could be corrupt or you may identify a bias for one particular Lane. If they are ok, then these files can be concatenated together before proceeding with all further steps. There are 2 workflows that will be used in Galaxy, with the first designed to work with each individual lane file and the second requiring 1 file per sample. This can be done by following these steps: Apply Rule to Collection tool Input collection is the list with the re-labelled data Press Edit button There should be 1 column titled A with the names of the files (the re-labelled names set previously) Make new columns with grouping information: Press +Column -&gt; Using a regular expression Select Create column matching expression groups Paste the following code into the Regular Expression box: (.*?)_L(.*) Set the number of groups to 2 Press Apply Set columns as identifiers for grouping: Press +Rules -&gt; Add / Modify Column Definitions Press +Add Definition -&gt; List Identifiers Select column B, then click on Assign another column and select C Press Apply Press Save, then Execute the job This outputs a nested list to the history. The number of items in the list should match the number of samples/animals, and then each sample in the list should contain the number of individual files (e.g. 2 or 3 files). To then join this datasets together, the tool Collapse Collection will work in the background to be the same as using the concatenate datasets tail-to-head tool to concatenate the files individually. Although not clear in the tools description, if it is provided a nested list, it will collapse the lowest level of groups together, in this case it is the Column C from above, which was the individual lanes. It should output a new list with the same number of files as the number of samples/animals. The names should be the names defined in Column B above: e.g. 2139_Stage 2_Fast: Open Collapse Collection tool Choose to use a dataset collection, not an individual file Select the nested list from above Execute with all other default settings "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
